## 1. Exploratory Testing Session of the Monefy App (Android)

### Overview
For this session, I chose the Android platform. The goal was to assess key functionalities of the Monefy app, including transaction management, settings customization, reporting, and backup/restore features.

### Exploratory Testing Charters

1. **Initial App Launch & Navigation**
   - **Objective:** Verify the installation, launch, and navigation of the app.
   - **Focus Areas:** Home screen load time, menu accessibility, intuitive navigation, UI element alignment.
   
2. **Transaction Entry (Income/Expense)**
   - **Objective:** Validate that users can add, edit, and delete both income and expense transactions.
   - **Focus Areas:** Correct amount entry, category selection, date/time stamps, updates to totals.

3. **Settings and Preferences**
   - **Objective:** Ensure that personalization options work as expected.
   - **Focus Areas:** Changing currency, theme, language; persistence of settings after app restart.

4. **Backup & Restore**
   - **Objective:** Verify that backup and restoration features protect user data.
   - **Focus Areas:** Successful backup creation, clarity of the restore process, handling of duplicate data.

5. **Category Management**
   - **Objective:** Verify the creation, editing and deletion of categories.
   - **Focus Areas:** Successful creation, editing and dleting of categories to ensure persistence
   and UI Consistency

### Findings from Exploratory Testing

- **Initial App Launch & Navigation**
  - The home screen loaded quickly. However, some icons lacked clear labels, leading to minor navigation confusion.
  - UI alignment issues were noted on devices with smaller screen sizes.

- **Transaction Entry**
  - **Positive:** Adding new income/expense transactions was generally smooth.
  - **Issues:** 
    - **Bug:** Editing an expense transaction did not update the overall totals immediately.
    - **Bug:** The deletion of a transaction sometimes required multiple attempts to register.
  
- **Settings and Preferences**
  - Currency changes were applied but not uniformly reflected in all UI areas.
  - Theme changes worked, though the update had a slight delay on some devices.

  
- **Backup & Restore**
  - Backup creation was successful; however, the restoration process lacked clear guidance and resulted in some duplicated data entries.

### Prioritisation of Charters

1. **Transaction Entry:**  
   - **Priority:** High  
   - **Reason:** Core functionality affecting data accuracy; bugs here can mislead financial tracking.
   
2. **Backup & Restore:**  
   - **Priority:** High  
   - **Reason:** Risks data loss or duplication, directly impacting user trust and data integrity.
   
3. **Settings and Preferences:**  
   - **Priority:** Medium  
   - **Reason:** While important for personalization, issues here have less impact on the core financial operations.
   
   
5. **Initial App Launch & Navigation:**  
   - **Priority:** Low  
   - **Reason:** UI misalignments and labeling issues are less critical compared to transactional errors.

### Risks & Mitigation Strategies

- **Data Integrity Risk:**  
  - *Risk:* Inaccurate transaction updates/deletions could lead to misleading financial data.  
  - *Mitigation:* Enhance automated tests for CRUD operations and implement data validation routines.

- **User Experience Risk:**  
  - *Risk:* Poor UI alignment and delayed updates may frustrate users.  
  - *Mitigation:* Conduct thorough UI/UX testing on multiple devices and refine responsiveness.

- **Data Loss Risk:**  
  - *Risk:* Inadequate backup/restore processes might result in data loss or duplication.  
  - *Mitigation:* Improve user guidance during backup/restore and perform integration tests for data consistency.

- **Performance Risk:**  
  - *Risk:* Slow report generation could hinder the user experience.  
  - *Mitigation:* Optimize backend processing and consider caching strategies for frequently generated reports.
